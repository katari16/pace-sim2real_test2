# ⚙️ PACE — Precise Adaptation through Continuous Evolution

PACE is a framework for **sim-to-real transfer of diverse robotic systems**, combining data-driven system identification with evolutionary optimization.
It enables accurate actuator modeling and robust adaptation from simulation to reality by explicitly learning physically meaningful dynamics parameters.

---

## What is PACE?

PACE bridges the gap between simulation and real hardware by:

* Estimating actuator and joint dynamics directly from measured data
* Using CMA-ES for robust parameter optimization
* Applying learned parameters to improve sim-to-real locomotion performance
* Supporting multiple robot platforms and actuator types

It is designed to integrate seamlessly with **NVIDIA Isaac Lab** and follows its task and environment conventions.

## Installation

### 1. Install Isaac Lab

Follow the official Isaac Lab installation guide:
[https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html)

We recommend using the **conda** or **uv** installation method, as this simplifies running Python scripts from the terminal and managing dependencies.

### 2. Clone this repository

Clone or copy this project separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-org>/pace-sim2real.git
cd pace-sim2real
```

### 3. Install PACE in editable mode

Using a Python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed:

```bash
# Use 'PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python'
# if Isaac Lab is not installed in a Python venv or conda environment
python -m pip install -e source/pace_sim2real
```

## 📚 Local Documentation Preview (TODO adjust once open sourcing)

Even if the website is not yet public, you can view the documentation locally.

### Quick preview

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

Then open in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## 🐾 Running an Example: ANYmal D

### 1. Activate the Isaac Lab environment

```bash
conda activate <isaaclab_env>
cd path/to/pace-sim2real
```

### 2. Collect excitation data

(Alternatively, place your own real-world data in `data/`)

```bash
python scripts/pace/data_collection.py
```

### 3. Run PACE parameter fitting

```bash
python scripts/pace/fit.py
```

This will estimate the actuator and joint parameters using CMA-ES and store results in:

```
logs/pace/<robot_name>/
```

---

## 🛠 Code Formatting

We provide a pre-commit configuration to automatically format and lint the codebase.

### Install pre-commit

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

### Enable hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Run manually

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

### Pylance: Missing Indexing of Extensions

In some VS Code versions, indexing for Isaac Lab extensions may be incomplete. Add your extension path to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
    "<path-to-ext-repo>/source/pace_sim2real"
  ]
}
```

---

### Pylance: Crash / High Memory Usage

If Pylance crashes due to excessive indexing, exclude unused omniverse packages by commenting them out in:

`.vscode/settings.json` → `python.analysis.extraPaths`

Examples of packages that can often be safely excluded:

```json
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.anim.*",
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.kit.*",
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.graph.*",
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.services.*"
```
